Clarification Questions
Is the hierarchy Platform → ART → Project → Release always consistent, or can projects span multiple ARTs?

Should Source and Target systems be stored in one mapping table or separately?

Can a Release have multiple source and multiple target systems?

Are test_run_id and test_id globally unique (GitLab + Jira)?

What’s the preferred ingestion path — direct API, JSON intermediate, or CSV extract?

Should all IDs be system-generated or align with IDs from Jira/GitLab?

Are lowercase snake_case names confirmed for Postgres?

Do we need to store historical versions or just current snapshots?
